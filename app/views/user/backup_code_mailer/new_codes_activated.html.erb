  Hey <%= @user.first_name %>,
</p>

<p>
  You've just generated new backup codes for HCB, and have 10 codes available to use in case you're unable to authenticate using other means. Please make sure to save the codes in a safe place. HCB staff will never ask for your backup codes.
</p>

<p>
  If this was you, great! If you didn't do this, please <%= mail_to "hcb@hackclub.com", "contact us", subject: "Unauthorized backup codes generated" %> immediately.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks,<br>
  The HCB Team
