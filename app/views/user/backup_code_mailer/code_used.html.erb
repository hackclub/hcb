  Hey <%= @user.first_name %>,
</p>

<p>
  You've just used one of your backup codes to login to HCB
  <% if @user.backup_codes.active.size == 0 %>
    and have none left. We strongly urge you to regenerate more codes at your earliest convenience in your <%= link_to "user settings", security_user_url(@user) %> to ensure you can always access your account.
  <% elsif @user.backup_codes.active.size <= 3 %>
    and only have <%= @user.backup_codes.active.size %> left. We strongly urge you to regenerate more codes at your earliest convenience in your <%= link_to "user settings", security_user_url(@user) %> to ensure you can always access your account.
  <% else %>
    .
  <% end %>
</p>

<p>
  If this was you, great! If you didn't do this, please <%= mail_to "hcb@hackclub.com", "contact us", subject: "Unauthorized access with backup code" %> immediately.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks,<br>
  The HCB Team
