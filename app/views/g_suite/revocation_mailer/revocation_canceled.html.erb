<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>
  We've canceled the revocation for your Google Workspace on
  <code><%= @g_suite.domain %></code> because you have taken action to correct
  the issues we informed you of. No further action is required on your part. No
  data or accounts have been deleted, and you can continue to access Google
  Workspace through HCB as usual.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks for getting that sorted! Please don't hesitate to reply with any
  questions.
</p>

<p>
  Best,<br>
  The HCB Team
</p>
