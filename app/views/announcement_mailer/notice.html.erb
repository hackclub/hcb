  Hey<%= " all" if @emails.size > 1 %>,
</p>

<p>
  We recently launched a new feature on HCB - organization announcements! This will help you send out announcements on HCB to people who follow your organization.
  For more details, check out <%= link_to "our blog post", "https://blog.hcb.hackclub.com/posts/organization-announcements" %> and the new Announcement page on any of your organizations.
</p>

<% if @monthly_announcement.present? %>
  <p>
    We've also automatically enabled monthly announcements for your organization!
    Monthly announcements are a part of organization features that automatically generates a announcement each month to send out to your followers.
  </p>

  <p>
    By default, they will include a short message and public data about you organization from the past month such as donation and spending summaries.
    We've already generated your first monthly announcement to be sent on <%= @scheduled_for.strftime("%B %-d") %> - <%= link_to "view or edit it on HCB", announcement_url(@monthly_announcement) %>!
  </p>

  <p>If you would like to disable monthly announcements, you can do so in <%= link_to "your organization settings", edit_event_url(@event) %>.</p>
<% end %>

<p>
  Sincerely,
  <br><br>
  The HCB Team
