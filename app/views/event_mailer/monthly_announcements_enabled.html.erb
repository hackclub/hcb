  <%= @whodunnit.preferred_name.presence || @whodunnit.full_name %> (an <%= @event.ancestor_organizer_positions.map(&:user).include?(@whodunnit) ? "organization manager" : "HCB admin" %>) has enabled monthly announcements for <%= @event.name %>.
  This is a feature that automatically generates an announcement each month to send out to your followers.
  For more information about announcements, check out <%= link_to "our blog post", "https://blog.hcb.hackclub.com/posts/organization-announcements" %>.
</p>

<p>
  By default, each monthly announcement includes summarized data about your organization from the past month, such as donations and spending analyses, but you can edit the announcement to include whatever you'd like.
  Your first monthly announcement has been generated and is scheduled to be sent on <%= @scheduled_for.strftime("%B #{@scheduled_for.day.ordinalize}") %> - <%= link_to "view or edit it on HCB", announcement_url(@monthly_announcement) %>!
  If your organization doesn't have any activity from this month to include in the announcement by <%= @warning_date.strftime("%B #{@warning_date.day.ordinalize}") %>, the announcement will not be sent.
</p>

<p>Managers can disable monthly announcements at any time in <%= link_to "your organization settings", edit_event_url(@event) %>.</p>
