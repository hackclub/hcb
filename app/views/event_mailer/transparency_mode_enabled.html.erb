  <%= @whodunnit.preferred_name.presence || @whodunnit.full_name %> (an <%= @event.ancestor_organizer_positions.map(&:user).include?(@whodunnit) ? "organization manager" : "HCB admin" %>) has enabled transparency mode for <%= @event.name %>.
  With transparency mode enabled:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unauthenticated users will be able to access a <strong>read-only</strong> version of your organization.</li>
  <li>None of HCB&apos;s pages will change for signed in team members.</li>
  <li>We&apos;ll do our best to redact contact info, but we can&apos;t guarantee it doesn't show up in these
    fields:
    <ul>
      <li>Transaction display names</li>
      <li>Sponsor company names</li>
      <li>ACH transfer recipients</li>
      <li>Check recipients</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Your <%= link_to "announcements page", event_announcement_overview_url(@event) %> will always be visible.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Managers can disable transparency mode at any time in <%= link_to "your organization settings", edit_event_url(@event) %>.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, managers can enable monthly announcements in <%= link_to "your organization settings", edit_event_url(@event) %>.
  If enabled, HCB will generate a new announcement each month that includes summarized data about your organization from the past month.
