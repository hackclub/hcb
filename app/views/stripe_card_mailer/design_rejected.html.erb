  ðŸ‘‹ Hey there,
</p>

<p>
  We just wanted to let you know that our card issuer (Stripe) rejected your
  logo for the following reason:
</p>

<blockquote><%= @reason %></blockquote>

<p>
  Any cards previously requested with this rejected logo will have the standard
  HCB card design. Feel free to upload a new logo
  on <%= link_to "your organization's settings page", edit_event_url(@event) %>.
</p>

<p>
  Best,
</p>

<p>
  The HCB Team
