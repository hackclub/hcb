    <p><strong>Want some HCB stickers?</strong> You can request an envelope full of them for yourself or your teammates! Every shipment request is manually sent out by the HCB team, and every envelope is personally prepared, packed, and mailed, with the address handwritten.</p>
    <p><em><strong>With great power comes great responsibility...</strong></em></p>
    <p>Please enjoy responsibly. HCB operates at a loss that donors pay for, and stickers are not cheapâ€”every package costs real donor money.</p>
