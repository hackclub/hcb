    Since you run on HCB, you can issue
    <%= link_to "Presidential Volunteer Service Awards",
      "https://presidentialserviceawards.gov",
      target: :_blank %>
    to volunteers (including to yourself and team members).
    While applying you'll be asked to provide evidence for the submitted volunteer hours (instructions and examples are provided on the application form).
  </p>

  <p>
    While HCB is registered with PVSA as a certifying organization and will submit rewards on your behalf, the costs charged by PVSA for certificates and medals will come from your own budget.
    Certificates and medals are shipped to one address and you'll distribute them from there.
