<p>Hey <%= @user.name %>! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>
  Welcome to HCB, Hack Club's fiscal sponsorship program! We're excited to help
  you get started with <b><%= @event.name %></b>. To best make use of your HCB,
  we've included three simple steps to get started!
</p>

<%= render "application_mailer/fancy_list" do %>
  <%= render "application_mailer/fancy_list/item",
             title: "Add an event logo",
             link: edit_event_url(@event, "details"),
             image: "/assets/logo.gif" do %>
    Upload a high-quality logo for your event or project. This will be
    displayed on your HCB page and help create a strong visual identity.
  <% end %>

  <%= render "application_mailer/fancy_list/item",
             title: "Add a transparcency message",
             link: edit_event_url(@event, "details"),
             image: "/assets/bio.gif" do %>
    Write a brief description of your organization or project. This helps
    potential donors understand your goals and mission, and is shown to them
    when they visit your HCB page!
  <% end %>

  <%= render "application_mailer/fancy_list/item",
             title: "Set up your donations page",
             link: edit_event_url(@event, "donations") do %>
    Add a project description, and a banner to your donations page - you
    can also allow donors to give anonymously, and to cover your fees!
  <% end %>
<% end %>
