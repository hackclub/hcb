# Pull Request Guide

- Use the PR template
- Preferably, prefix your branch names with your name. e.g. `garyhtou/branch-name`
- Update your branch by merging `main` into your feature branch rather than rebasing. Rebasing will create new commits causing review comments to shift out of order.
- Run `bin/lint -c`
- When merging PRs into main, squash and rebase
