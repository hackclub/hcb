Welcome to the [HCB](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/) codebase. We are so excited to have you. With your help, we can make HCB the best platform to run a nonprofit.

## What is HCB?

HCB is a powerful, safe, and easy-to-use fiscal sponsorship platform for hackathons, Hack Clubs, robotic teams and more. We use it to run our [fiscal sponsorship program](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/), we provide high schoolers with a 501(c)(3) status-backed restricted fund for their organization. Behind the scenes, HCB is a Ruby on Rails application (learn more by reading [our documentation](/dev-docs)).
